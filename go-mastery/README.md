# üìò GoLang Exercises Directory

Welcome to the **GoLang Exercises Directory**! This repository is designed to provide a **structured learning path** covering all fundamental and advanced topics in Go. Each topic is accompanied by a dedicated exercise file with **self-contained challenges** to help reinforce your understanding of Go.

## üöÄ How to Use This Repository

Each directory contains a `main.go` file with **exercise prompts** written as comments. Your task is to complete them **without looking at references** to strengthen your memory and problem-solving skills.

### üîß Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/golang-exercises.git
   cd golang-exercises
   ```
2. Run any exercise:
   ```sh
   go run XX_topic/main.go
   ```
   > Note: Replace `XX_topic` with the actual folder name (e.g., `01_hello_world`).
3. Use the provided `run.sh` script to compile-check all exercises.
